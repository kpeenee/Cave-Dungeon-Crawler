# Cave-Dungeon-Crawler
This project is about making a video game in the ***Roguelike*** genre. 
A ***Roguelike*** is a type of game that has random level generation and permadeath at its core, 
and can then expanded upon with unique mechanics and systems such as turn based combat.

# Why a Roguelike?
For me personaly I have always been drawn to the ***Roguelike*** genre. 
Games such as **The Binding Of Isaac** or **Enter The Gungeon** start off being deceptively simple making it easy for anyone to get into, 
but can quickly open up as you discover new systems and secrets within the game. 
These games can also provide a unique and intense experience usualy within only an hour of gameplay just through the sheer amount of variety and replayability they provide.
As a game developer I have always wanted to explore the process of procedural generation and what really makes it hit the right spot for players.

# My Idea
For my game I would like to create a 3D fantasy dungeon crawler with a focus on these ***Roguelike*** elements to try and make a game which is accessible to every player
casual or hardcore. I would like the game to be different evertime the player plays it through some sort of procedural level generation and different items on each run. 
To set this game aside from other ***Roguelikes*** I plan on maing it so the main player is also random each time you play, so on one run of the game you could be playing
as a knight charging head first into the enemies but then on the next run you could be a mage casting spells and keeping your distance.
