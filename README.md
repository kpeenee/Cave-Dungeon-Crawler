# Cave-Dungeon-Crawler
This project is about making a video game in the ***Roguelike*** genre. 
A ***Roguelike*** is a type of game that has random level generation and permadeath at its core, 
and can then expanded upon with unique mechanics and systems such as turn based combat.

# Why a Roguelike?
For me personaly I have always been drawn to the ***Roguelike*** genre. 
Games such as **The Binding Of Isaac** or **Enter The Gungeon** start off being deceptively simple making it easy for anyone to get into, 
but can quickly open up as you discover new systems and secrets within the game. 
These games can also provide a unique and intense experience usualy within only an hour of gameplay just through the sheer amount of variety and replayability they provide.
As a game developer I have always wanted to explore the process of procedural generation and what really makes it hit the right spot for players.

# My Idea
For my game I would like to create a 3D fantasy dungeon crawler with a focus on these ***Roguelike*** elements to try and make a game which is accessible to every player
casual or hardcore. I would like the game to be different evertime the player plays it through some sort of procedural level generation and different items on each run. 
To set this game aside from other ***Roguelikes*** I plan on maing it so the main player is also random each time you play, so on one run of the game you could be playing
as a knight charging head first into the enemies but then on the next run you could be a mage casting spells and keeping your distance. 

# Technology im using
For this project im going to be using
- Unity 2020.1.11f1 ***(May upgrade as new versions come out)***
- Visual Studio 2019
- Audacity
- Blender v2.81
- FL Studio 20
- GIMP 2.10.22

All of these programs will be used to code and create assets such as 3D models and sounds for the game.

# Main features
- Procedural generated levels
- Permadeath
- First person combat
- At least 30 weapons with different stats and effects
- Leveling up and skill trees unique to each character
- At least 20 different enemies and many bosses to fight

# Aim
By christmas I hope to have the generation of my levels set up with a playable prototype creating one level. 
The one level that gets created should show off the key features of the game like the combat and variety of items.

After christmas the main focus will be on creating many new items and skills for the player to get, as well as creating the rest of the levels.
