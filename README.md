This project is about making a video game in the Roguelike genre. 
A Roguelike is a type of game that has random level generation and permadeath at its core, 
and can then expanded upon with unique mechanics and systems such as turn based combat.

# Why a Roguelike?
For me personaly I have always been drawn to the Roguelike genre. 
Games such as ***The Binding Of Isaac*** or ***Enter The Gungeon*** start off being deceptively simple making it easy for anyone to get into, 
but can quickly open up as you discover new systems and secrets within the game. 
These games can also provide a unique and intense experience usualy within only an hour of gameplay just through the sheer amount of variety and replayability they provide.
